-->DESCRIPTION
	Senderxx Chat App as the name implies is an online application that enables a means of communiation through texting. 
It was written in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. But for the purposed for this competition, it was compiled and can now run both 
on a PC (prefferably with Windows OS) and an Android device. The name of the messaging application is called "Senderxx ChatApp" or 
simply "Senderxx" for short

-->HOW TO USE
	There are three ways in which this program can be ran:

  -Through the executable: Is the recommended format in which this file should be ran. To access it follow this directory;
    [Senderxx_Desktop -> executable -> Senderxx Chat app.exe] (click on the .exe file). This will lead you straight to the 
    the website of Senderxx in which this application was originally developed in. (NB: An ad may appear at the bottom of the page, 
    this ad was not part of the project, it was added by the web host, it will be seen no matter the way the program is ran)

  -Through the setup: This method involves setting up of the application like a desktop app through a setup wizard. phpdesktop
    and inosetup was used to make this method available. This process may contain bugs or not work depending on your system (involving the set up not the actual
    program that was intended for the competition). To access it follow this directory; [Senderxx_Desktop -> setup -> installer -> Senderxx_ChatApp_setup.exe]
    (click on the .exe file, this is the set up). If the set up or starting of the application fails, consider opening this file as a replacement
    [Senderxx_Desktop -> setup -> installer -> debug -> Senderxx -> Senderxx ChatApp.exe] (This is the application, but already set up) or try installing PHP (linked below). 
    But again, this method depends on your system.

  -Through android: This is the method is the application compiled to a version for mobile phones (only works on Android phones).
    thunkable was used to make this process possible. To access it follow this directory; [Senderxx_Mobile -> Senderxx%20ChatApp-v1-release.apk].
    To run this, transfer the file to any android phone or simply employ the use of an emulator.

	Ultimately, you can visit the website here: [https://sndchatapp.000webhostapp.com/index.php]. Chrome may not run this properly though, so try any other browser
like Microsoft Edge, Opera etc. Or simply visit this site on incognito mode.
	After successfully running the application, sign up and test all the features of the application. you can easily open 
a new window to form a second user to chat with (two default users have already been put in for design purposes).

-->ALGORITHM AND STRUCTURE
	This program was written in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. And depending on the method you ran it was compiled to a 
a desktop application (through phpdesktop and inosetup) and android application. It was uploaded online through [www.000webhost.com]
In summary, what this program takes in your sign up information, stores it on an online server (phpMyAdmin), starts a session, displays all
users available to chat with on the application, Then when you click on a user it leads you to a chat room, this then displays your previous
messages that you sent plus allowing you to send messages to the user. The source code is included in the extras file.
